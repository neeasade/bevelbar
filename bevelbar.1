.SH NAME
bevelbar \- X11 status bar with beveled borders
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbevelbar\fP \fICONFIGURATION ...\fP
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
Draw an X11 status bar. The program waits for input on \fISTDIN\fP, see
format below.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH OPTIONS
Colors are specified as strings that can be understood by
\fBXftColorAllocName()\fP, e.g. \fB#112233\fP or \fBred\fP.
.P
Note: All of these options must be present in this exact order.
.TP
\fIhorizontal_alignment\fP
.TQ
\fIvertical_alignment\fP
Must be one of \fBleft\fP, \fBcenter\fP, \fBright\fP, and \fBtop\fP,
\fBbottom\fP, respectively. This tells \fBbevelbar\fP where to place the
bar window. For each XRandR screen, one individual window will be
created.
.TP
\fIhorizontal_margin\fP
.TQ
\fIvertical_margin\fP
The windows' minimum distances to screen edge in number of pixels. These
options are integers.
.TP
\fIouter_bevel\fP
.TQ
\fIinner_bevel\fP
Size in pixels of the bevel to draw. These options are integers. Can be
0 to not draw any bevel at all. \fIinner_bevel\fP refers to the bevel of
individual segments.
.TP
\fIseg_margin\fP
Segments can have a margin (both horizontally and vertically) around
them which is set by this option. This option is an integer value and
measured in pixels.
.TP
\fIseg_size_empty\fP
Defines the horizontal size of empty segments. This option is an integer
value and measured in pixels.
.TP
\fIfont\fP
Xft font descriptor, e.g. \fBTerminus:pixelsize=10\fP.
.TP
\fIcol_empty\fP
Color of empty segments.
.TP
\fIcol_outer_bright\fP
.TQ
\fIcol_outer_dark\fP
Colors of the global outer border. The \(lqbright\(rq color will be used
on the left and top, the \(lqdark\(rq color will be used at the bottom
and on the right.
.P
Following these basic options, you can define different styles.
Throughout your input data, you can switch styles. You must define at
least one style. You can define 10 styles, tops. A style consists of
four colors, all of which must be present:
.TP
\fIcol_segment_background\fP
.TQ
\fIcol_segment_foreground\fP
Background color and text color.
.TP
\fIcol_segment_bright\fP
.TQ
\fIcol_segment_dark\fP
Similar to the colors of the global outer border, these options set the
colors of the borders of individual segments.

.SH "INPUT FORMAT"
As soon as input is available on \fISTDIN\fP, \fBbevelbar\fP will read
one complete input block and then draw it. This means that it will block
until the block is complete. Each of the following commands must be
terminated by a newline character and must not contain any leading or
trailing white space.
.P
.IP \(bu 4
An input block starts with an integer which designates the desired
monitor to draw the following sub-block on. You can also use \fBa\fP to
draw the same input on all monitors.
.IP \(bu 4
You can now define multiple segments. Each segment will have its own
border. A segment has the format \fI<style><text>\fP (of course, this
command has to be terminated by a newline). \fIstyle\fP is an integer to
select one of the styles defined by your command line arguments. Style
indexes start at 0, so the highest usable style index is 9.
.IP \(bu 4
Instead of actual text, you can also request an empty segment using a
simple dash: \fB-\fP.
.IP \(bu 4
Alternatively, you can begin the line with \fBi\fP, followed by a
\fIstyle\fP as described above. After these two characters, a path to a
farbfeld image is expected. For image format and tools please refer to
.UR http://git.suckless.org/farbfeld/
suckless.org
.UE .
.IP \(bu 4
Multiple segments or empty segments can follow. To designate the end of
input for this monitor, you must send an \fBe\fP.
.IP \(bu 4
You can now either select another monitor and supply more input, or you
can terminate the input by sending an \fBf\fP. This final \fBf\fP causes
the bar to be redrawn.
.P
