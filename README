                                ========


Draw an X11 status bar with fancy schmancy 1985-ish beveled borders.


Installation
------------

The following C libraries are required:

    - libx11
    - libxft
    - libxrandr

The program expects to be run on a POSIX-ish operating system.

To build the program and install it to /usr/local:

    $ make
    # make install


Running
-------

The program waits for input on STDIN. Hence, you must combine it with
some other program which creates said input:

    $ other_program | while sleep 0.1; do bevelbar $args; done

For a brief description of the input format and $args, please see
example-run.sh.

bevelbar does not handle changes to your screen layout. When you add,
remove or rearrange monitors, you have to restart the program. This is
why I'm using a while-loop in the example above -- you can then simply
issue a "killall bevelbar".
